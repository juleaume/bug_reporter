# Bug reporter
This tool is used to generate bug reports in a fancy way, and to make sure not to forget anything.

### HOW TO INSTALL
1. clone the repo where you normally do
2. create a venv or if you don't care about them, go directly to 3
3. install PySide2: `pip install PySide2`
4. you should be good to go

### HOW TO USE
launch it using the terminal 

`$ python main.py`

Enter each item, they are important for the investigation. Be concise yet as precise as possible.

You can add an external file but this won't do anything for now, except maybe remind you to send it along-side with the report.

Once you're done, click either on the report or mail button. Don't forget the attachment.
